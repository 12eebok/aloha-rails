Description:
    Installs Aloha configuration files (initializer and js config) and
    integrates Aloha to the assets pipeline.

Example:
    rails generate aloha:install

    This will create config files (edit them later):
        app/assets/javascripts/aloha-config.coffee
        config/initializers/aloha.rb
    ...and will change application.css and application.js assets pipeline files to use Aloha.
